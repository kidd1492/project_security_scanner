# AI-Powered Code Security Scanner

## Overview
**AI-Powered Code Security Scanner** is an advanced security-focused tool designed to **analyze, classify, and assess** software projects. It leverages **structured extraction** and a **custom Ollama AI model** to identify the **project type** (Flask, Django, Node.js, etc.), generate an **overview**, and recommend **security scans** tailored to the project's architecture.

Beyond just classification, this tool **executes security scans** using tools like **Bandit, OWASP ZAP, JSLint, and others**, refining a project's security posture. The final stage involves a **comprehensive AI-driven security review**, providing **detailed recommendations** for improving the project's safetyâ€”ensuring non-coders and AI-generated code users understand security flaws and how to fix them.

## Features
- âœ… **Project type classification** (Flask, Django, Node.js, etc.)
- âœ… **Structured data extraction** generating insightful **JSON reports**
- âœ… **AI-generated project summary** for better visibility
- âœ… **Intelligent security scan recommendations** based on project type
- âœ… **Execution of security scans** using tools like Bandit, OWASP, JSLint
- âœ… **AI-driven security evaluation** for actionable improvements
- âœ… **User-friendly CLI execution** for seamless analysis

## Next Steps ðŸš€
- ðŸ”¹ Execute the **recommended security scans** and **generate an overall report**
- ðŸ”¹ Leverage AI to **evaluate security findings**, suggest **improvements**, and explain **why and how** fixes should be implemented
- ðŸ”¹ Expand **language support** and security checks for broader usability
- ðŸ”¹ Automate AI-driven security assessments **within CI/CD pipelines**
